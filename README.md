[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aimacode/aima-julia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aimacode/aima-julia)

Julia (v0.5+) implementation of the algorithms found in "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach".

## Acknowledgements

The algorithms implemented in this project are found from both Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" and [aima-pseudocode](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-pseudocode).

## Intent

The intent of this fork is to align the code with a clearer interface like structure which is there in the aima-java like structure.
